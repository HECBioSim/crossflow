from pathlib import Path

# Create two short text files:
here = Path(".")
file1 = here / "file1.txt"
file1.write_text("content\n")
file2 = here / "file2.txt"
file2.write_text("more content\n")

# Create a Subprocesstask that will join input files together:
joiner = tasks.SubprocessTask("cat * > output")
joiner.set_inputs(["*"])
joiner.set_outputs(["output"])

# The task expects an arbitrary number of input files, so put the inputs
# into a list, and then call the task:
inputs = [file1, file2]
joined = joiner(inputs)

# Save the output FileHandle object as a file, and list its contents:
output = here / "joined.txt"
joined.save(output)
print(output.read_text())
