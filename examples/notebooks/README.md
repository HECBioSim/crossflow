# Jupyter notebooks with Crossflow examples.

The notebooks "Crossflow 101" and "Simple Workflow" illustrate basic principles through toy systems that do not require access to any extra specialist software packages.

The "Amber" directory contains an example of a workflow that uses the **Amber** molecular modelling package and will require **Amber** or **Ambertools** to be installed.

The "Gromacs" directory is similar, but will require a local installation of the molecular modelling package **Gromacs**.

The "PockDock" directory contains a workflow that requires **AutoDock Vina**, **AutoDock Tools**, and **FPocket** to be installed.
